# Programmin is a fun, creative skill to develop.
# Whether you've mastered the basics os Python syntax or simply want to
# dive into some real Python programs, the projects
# in this book will spark new ideas for what's possible with as little
# as a few pages of code.
#     The best way to work through these programs isn't to merely
# read theis code or copy and past it to your computer. Take the time
# to manually type the code from this book into your editor
# to develop the muscle memory of wwriting code. This also slows you
# down so you can considr each line as you type, instead of merely
# skimming it over with your eyes. Look up any instructions you don't
# recognize using an internet search engine, or experiment
# with them in the interactive sheel.
#     Finally, take it upn yourself to re-create the
# program from scratch and ten modifu it features of your own.
# These exercises give you a solid foundation for how
# programming concepts are applied to create actual, runnable programs.
# And moost of all, don't forget to have fun"
